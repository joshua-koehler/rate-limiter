//! The request pipeline: a **pluggable, per-route chain of stages**.
//!
//! This is the load-bearing extensibility decision (criteria.md: "another
//! engineer could extend with a new config feature in an afternoon"). Instead of
//! a hard-coded sequence of `if` blocks, the pipeline is an ordered list of
//! [`Stage`] trait objects, **assembled per route from the parsed config** at
//! startup ([`assemble`]) and iterated in order. Adding a config feature is:
//!   1. add the config struct (in `config`),
//!   2. add one file implementing [`Stage`] (in this module),
//!   3. `push` it in [`assemble`] (request phase) or [`assemble_response`]
//!      (response phase) under the right condition — no change to the core loop
//!      below.
//!
//! One deliberate exception to "everything registers in `assemble`": request
//! *body* mapping runs at the body-buffer boundary in `upstream::proxy`, not as a
//! Stage — a `Stage` operates on the un-buffered `Request<Incoming>`, and you
//! cannot swap an `Incoming` body for buffered bytes inside `&mut RequestCtx`.
//! The retry loop already buffers the body once, so mapping it there avoids a
//! second buffering pass (see `assemble`'s P3 seam and DECISIONS.md).
//!
//! Intended full order (later tiers slot stages into `assemble` at the seams):
//!   route match (selects the chain)  → method → auth → rate limit
//!   → request transform → circuit-breaker gate → target select
//!   → timeout+retry around the upstream call → response transform → return
//!
//! Fast-reject stages (404 pre-chain, 405/401/429/503…) short-circuit *before*
//! any upstream work by returning [`Flow::ShortCircuit`].
